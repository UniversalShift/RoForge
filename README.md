## ⚡ RoForge ⚡

RoForge is a goofy solo-made launcher for Roblox. You can:
- Create modpacks/profiles for easy modding.
- Use tons of mods/texture packs (see our [Mod Creation Guide](https://github.com/UniversalShift/RoForge/wiki/Mod-Creation)).
- Customize Roblox to be 100x better!

It has bugs, but I’m making it BETTER. My code’s a HUGE mess I'm sorry, lol!

Got ideas? Let me know!

**Note**: Windows Defender may flag it, but it’s safe. Check the code yourself!
